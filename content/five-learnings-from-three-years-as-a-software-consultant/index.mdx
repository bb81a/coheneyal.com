I’ve been working as a software consultant for 3 years now.

It took me a while to understand that the right approach can make the difference between just getting by or being frustrated to being happy and fulfilled.

## Finding Clients Doesn’t Have to be Hard

As software engineers, we are lucky to live in an area where there’s (still) a lot of demand for software engineers.

But every new consultant I speak to is struggling to find first clients.

And as a consultant, you are nothing without clients.

From my experience, it doesn’t have to be hard. Here’s what helped me making it easier:

### Use Platforms or Mediators

There are lot of companies connecting between projects and consultants.

Some take a fee on top of your rate, some require monthly subscription.

Personally, I’ve used and happy with a.team. There’s a lot of demand on the platform, the rates are great, and their team is absolutely amazing.
few others that I’ve heard of but never used are TopTal, Turing, and lemon.io.

### Share your work

I’ve had many clients coming to me organically.
How? They’ve read my posts, saw my GitHub profile, or stumbled upon a comment on Twitter. The more you share, the more you’re noticed.

### Network

I know it’s such a cliché, but **your next client could already be in your network.**

I’ve always been active in my local developer community. In fact, my first client project came from a Whatsapp group of leading Israeli front-end developers.

Letting your network know that you’ve started consulting can open doors to new opportunities — your next big client might just be a message away.

# Communication, Communication, Communication

Working with clients is a lot more about people and relationships than technology. And trust is the cornerstone of work relationships.

Your clients need to know they can rely on you. **To build trust, communicate effectively.**

I’ve encountered various communication styles — asynchronous, meeting-heavy, formal, casual, phone-oriented, or text-based. In every case, **clear communication makes everything smoother,** from discussing project status and pricing to technology choices and deadlines.

Poor communication leads to friction, the antithesis of trust. It can cause project delays, misunderstandings, and ultimately, dissatisfaction for both you and the client. **Avoid this by being proactive and transparent.**

What helped me the most:

**Honesty and Transparency**: This is fundamental. You don’t have to share everything, but accurately depicting the situation and showing your work is crucial.

**Proactive Approach**: Don’t wait for issues to escalate. If you anticipate missing a deadline, inform the client immediately. They’ll appreciate the heads-up.

**Availability and Accessibility**: Timely responses are essential. While you shouldn’t be on-call 24/7, responding quickly and being available helps close loops faster and prevents clients from waiting on crucial matters. Being accessible means clients can reach you when needed.

## Prioritize Time for Your Business

Consulting isn’t just about client work; it involves managing taxes, legal matters, and more. Allocating time for these is crucial.

In my first consulting year, I’ve learned this the hard way.

Juggling four different clients left no room for organizing my business, leading to missed opportunities and a mess.

**Since my first year, I’ve dedicated at least half a day each week to review, plan, and think**. This helps keep everything in check, from finances to future planning.

Managing your business effectively is as important as your client work.

## Your job is to get things done

In consulting, your primary goal is simple: deliver results, no matter what.

While your expertise is your key asset, it’s the ability to execute effectively that truly distinguishes between success and failure.

**My focus has always been finding solutions to clients problems.**

Consistently delivering on your promises not only meets client expectations but also opens doors to new opportunities and helps build a strong professional reputation.

**A practical example of this lesson is that for client projects, I’m always using battle-proven technology.**

I’m always experimenting on the side, trying out new things, and playing with technology — but I do it on my spare time.

Client projects are the place for reliable, proven tools, that I know will do the job, even if they are not shiny or getting likes on Twitter.

I’m using only technology that I know is capable of getting the job done, and not putting the client or the deadlines at risk.

## Freedom Comes with a Price

While consulting offers great freedom and flexibility, it comes with its own set of challenges, unlike those faced by employees.

As a consultant, you’re in charge of managing changing income, handling your own taxes. It’s a different game from being an employee, where many of these aspects are managed for you.

**You’ve got more to juggle, more to think about.**

Balancing work and life was tough for me at first. It took time to figure it out. I’d work unusual hours, work on many projects in parallel, and neglected important aspects of personal life.

After the first year, I’ve found a rhythm that works for me. I understood what my limits are and what is important to me, And it’s incredibly fulfilling.

To me, The real rewards of consulting are in the flexibility, controlling my own time and path, and the satisfaction of getting real results out the door.

_These are my main 5 lessons. I hope this offers a perspective for someone else’s path._
