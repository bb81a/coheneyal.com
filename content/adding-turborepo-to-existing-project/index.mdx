I've recently built an open-source task management [app](https://github.com/eyalcohen4/GTD) in the "Getting Things Done" style.

When I came across the fantastic [novel.sh](https://novel.sh) WYSIWYG AI editor made by [Steven Tey](https://twitter.com/steventey), I wanted to plug it into my app.

But there was a problem: novel was written as a website and unavailable as an installable npm package.
So we've decided to make it an npm package.

We still wanted to keep the website running. We decided to convert the project to a monorepo using turborepo.

You can see the PR [here](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel/pull/87). It's gigantic and includes 78 changed files.

Thanks to Steven's help, we got it out of the door.

## What is turbo?

[turbo](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) is an incremental _bundler_ and _build system_ optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.

It consists of 2 parts:

- Turborepo: A CLI tool that runs on your machine and is responsible for building your project.
- Turbopack: an incremental bundler (the successor to Webpack)

[Jared Palmer](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer), who is also the creator of [Formik](https://formik.org/), built Turbo,
and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) acquired it in 2021.

I've written this guide to help others convert their project into a mono repo.

## The Goal

We aim to convert a single next.js project to a monorepo with two separate apps and a shared UI package that both will use.
The use case we'll mimic is a simple website with two sides - A public-facing and a dashboard.

We will start with a single next.js project, and convert it to a monorepo with separate packages for shared components and logic between 2 apps.
I love using the [next-template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/next-template) by Shadcn for its simplicity. we will use it as a starting point.

You can also see the result in this [repository](https://github.com/eyalcohen4/turborepo-nextjs-example), after we converted a single project to a monorepo.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed locally
- Node.js installed locally
- A basic understanding of Next.js and React

## Step 1: Creating the Project

We start by creating a new next.js application using the shadcn next-template:

```bash
$ npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/shadcn/next-template
```

Let's install a few components that will help us demonstrate our app:

```bash
$ npx shadcn-ui add dialog input label
```

As we start, we have a single next.js project, with a single package.json file.

To demonstrate turborepo, and make sure our package is working, we'll add a simple `SignIn` component to our project.
It'll be used in both our website and dashboard apps.

Create a new file inside the components folder, `sign-in.tsx`.
Go ahead and paste this component inside it:

```tsx title="components/sign-in.tsx"
"use client"

import { Button } from "./ui/button"
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "./ui/dialog"
import { Input } from "./ui/input"
import { Label } from "./ui/label"

export const SignIn = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogTrigger>
        <Button className="w-24" variant="destructive">
          Sign In
        </Button>
      </DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Sign in to your account</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              Enter your details below.
            </p>
          </DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        <form className="grid gap-8">
          <div className="grid gap-4">
            <div className="grid gap-2">
              <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
              <Input
                id="email"
                placeholder="name@example.com"
                type="email"
                autoCapitalize="none"
                autoComplete="none"
                autoCorrect="off"
              />
            </div>
            <div className="grid gap-2">
              <Label htmlFor="email">Password</Label>
              <Input
                id="email"
                type="password"
                autoCapitalize="none"
                autoComplete="none"
                autoCorrect="off"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <Button>Sign In with Email</Button>
        </form>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```

Now, let's render it inside the app. Replace `app/page.tsx` content with the following:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@/components/sign-in"

export default function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <section className="container grid items-center gap-6 pb-8 pt-6 md:py-10">
      <SignIn />
    </section>
  )
}
```

The sign-in button triggers a simple user authentication modal. It should look similar to this:

<Image src={`/images/turborepo/singin_button.gif`} width={1800} height={1200} />

Run the project to verify it's working:

```
$ pnpm run dev
```

## Step 2: Adding turborepo

To render the `SignIn` component in two different apps, we'd want to move it to a separate package.
That's where turborepo comes in.

We'll start by adding turborepo to our project.

```bash
$ pnpm add turbo --global
```

The second step is to create a `turbo.json` file in the repository root folder:

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```

We can now run `turbo dev` instead to start our project.

```bash
$ turbo dev
```

If everything was successful, you should see a similar output:

<Image src="/images/turborepo/turbo_dev.png" width={1800} height={1200} />

## Step 3: Convert The Project to a monorepo

Now that we have turborepo setup, we can convert our project to a monorepo.

Under the hood, turborepo uses the [workspaces](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/workspaces) feature package managers like pnpm and yarn.

> Workspaces are the building blocks of your monorepo.
> Each app and package you add to your monorepo will be inside its own workspace.
> [Turborepo Docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/workspaces)

We define workspaces through `package.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file.

Each workspace must have its `package.json` file inside as well.

A popular convention for monorepos is to create a `packages` folder for shared libraries, and a `apps` folder for apps.
That's customizable, but we'll follow it for this guide.

To convert our single project to a monorepo, we need three steps:

1. **Move our single app to an `apps` folder, where our web applications will be**
2. **Define our workspace by creating a `package.json` in the root folder**
3. **Create a `packages` folder. That's where we'll put our shared components and logic**

### 1. Move our single app to the `apps` folder

Run the following commands in the root folder of our project:

```bash
# create the apps folder
$ mkdir -p ./apps/website

# move the content of our project to the website folder (including hidden files)
# this command may result in an error:.
# > mv: rename ./apps to ./apps/website/apps: Invalid argument
# That's fine, you can ignore it.
$ mv ./** ./.** ./apps/website

# Move back the .git folder, .gitignore and .turbo files
$ mv ./apps/website/.git ./apps/website/.gitignore ./apps/website/.turbo ./

# create the dashboard folder
$ mkdir -p ./apps/dashboard

# copy the content of our project to the dashboard folder
$ cp -r ./apps/website/ ./apps/dashboard
```

The current repo structure should look like this:

```bash
[--] apps
[----] dashboard
[----] website
```

The next step is to update the names of the apps in the workspace.

```json title="apps/dashboard/package.json"
{
  "name": "dashboard",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true
}
```

```json title="apps/website/package.json"
{
  "name": "website",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true
}
```

### 2. Create a `package.json` in the root folder

Create and add the following content to `package.json` in the **project root folder**

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "the-best-monorepo",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "packageManager": "pnpm@6.14.1",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo dev"
  }
}
```

Now we'd need to add the workspaces config.

```yaml title="pnpm-workspaces.yaml"
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

### 3. Create the packages folder

We'd now want to create the packages folder to put our shared components in.
Run this command to create it:

```bash
  $ mkdir -p packages/ui/components
```

Our repo structure should look like this now:

```bash
[--] apps
[----] dashboard
[----] website
[--] packages
[----] ui
```

At the package/ui folder, go ahead and create a `package.json` file inside the package/ui, and add the following content:

```json title="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "ui",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true
}
```

We've now created the monorepo structure.

## Step 4: Create the UI Package Infrastructure

Let's create our UI package to share our SignIn component between our apps.

There are a few things we need to do:

- **Move the `SignIn` component to the UI package**
- **Install dependencies and add build/dev scripts**
- **Add config files for typescript and tailwind**

We'll start by copying the SignIn component to the UI package and the UI folder.

```bash
$ cp -r apps/website/components/sign-in.tsx apps/website/components/ui apps/website/lib/utils.ts ./packages/ui/components
```

### Dependencies & Scripts

Web applications that will use our UI package must have React installed.
We can enforce it via the `peerDependencies` `package.json` property.
We'll also need some other dependencies from our website app, so we'll also migrate them to the UI package.

Add the following to the UI package.json:

```bash title="packages/ui"
$ pnpm add @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-slot tailwindcss class-variance-authority clsx lucide-react sharp tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate
$ pnpm add -D tsup typescript postcss prettier eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-tailwind eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks autoprefixer @types/react
```

Now, we need to bundle the app using typescript and tailwind.
For typescript, I love to use [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/), which is a zero-config bundler for typescript.

We now need to edit the UI package `package.json` file in 2 ways:

1. **Add build & dev scripts**
2. **Add react as peerDependency**:
   We need React as a `peerDependency, because we want to avoid bundling it with our package, as it's already bundled with our apps.
   Consuming apps must have it installed, and we'll get a warning if they don't.

Add the following to the ui `package.json` file:

```json title="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup --watch"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.x.x"
  }
}
```

### Adding Config Files

To run typescript and tailwind, we must define our build configs to bundle our package.
The required tools are: `tsup`, `typesscript`, `tailwind`, and `postcss`.

Copy and paste the following files to the UI package:

```ts title="packages/ui/tsup.config.ts"
import { Options, defineConfig } from "tsup"

export default defineConfig((options: Options) => ({
  entry: ["index.ts"],
  banner: {
    js: "'use client'",
  },
  format: ["cjs", "esm"],
  dts: true,
  clean: true,
  external: ["react"],
  injectStyle: true,
  ...options,
}))
```

```json title="packages/ui/tsconfig.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "display": "Default",
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "inlineSources": false,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES6",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noUnusedLocals": false,
    "noUnusedParameters": false,
    "preserveWatchOutput": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

```js title="packages/ui/tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography"), require("tailwindcss-animate")],
}
```

```js title="packages/ui/postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

There's one last thing we need to add for next.js 13 so it'll transpile the package for us.

Add the following line to `apps/website/next.config.mjs` and `apps/dashboard/next.config.mjs`:

```js
transpilePackages: ["ui"],
```

We're now ready to run the package and see it in action!

## Step 5: Using The UI Package in the Apps

To use the `SignIn` component, we'll create a `index.ts` file to export it from the ui package.

```ts title="packages/ui/index.ts"
export { SignIn } from "./components/sign-in"
```

Run the following command inside the `packages/ui` folder

```bash title="packages/ui"
$ pnpm run build
```

You should see similar output:

<Image src="/images/turborepo/successfull_run.png" width={1800} height={1200} />

We can now add the UI package to our website and dashboard apps.
In both apps, add the UI package as a dependency to the `package.json` files:

```json title="apps/website/package.json | apps/dashboard/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ui": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

Run `pnpm install` to install on both folders.

We can now replace the import of the `SignIn` component with the one in our UI package, and use it in our website app.
Inside `apps/website/pages/index.tsx` and `apps/dashboard/pages/index.tsx`, replace the import of the SignIn component with the following:

```
import { SignIn } from "ui"
```

You should now see the same sign-in button as before, but this time, it's coming from the UI package.

To ensure we are using the same `SignIn` component, we can change the button color and see it updated on both apps.
This is also the premise - save duplicates and coding time.

Go to `packages/ui/components/sign-in.tsx`, line 20, and change the button variant to `destructive`:

```tsx title="packages/ui/components/sign-in.tsx:20"
<Button className="w-24">Sign In</Button>
```

The last step would be to rebuild the UI package. You can also re-build it on every change using `pnpm run dev`.

```bash title="packages/ui"
$ pnpm run dev
```

Open 2 new terminals and run the two apps:

```bash title="apps/website"
$ pnpm run dev
```

```bash title="apps/dashboard"
$ pnpm run dev
```

We should now see the changes reflected

<Image src="/images/turborepo/final-step.png" width={1800} height={1200} />

You can change more stuff and see the changes on both apps.

## Summary

We've now converted our single next.js project to a monorepo with two separate apps and shared packages for our UI components.

You can also publish the ui package to npm and use it in other projects outside the monorepo.

You can also create more shared packages and optimize your mono repo further - config, logic, and whatever makes sense to your company.

I hope you've enjoyed this guide and that it helped you understand how to convert your project to a mono repo.
