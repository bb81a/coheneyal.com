I've recently built an open-source Getting Things Done style [task management app](https://github.com/eyalcohen4/GTD) for myself.

When I came across the amazing [novel.sh](https://novel.sh) editor made by [Steven Tey](https://twitter.com/steventey), I really wanted to plug it into my app.

But there was a problem: Novel wasn't as a library, it was a website. After speaking with Steven, we've decided to make it an npm package.

We still wanted to keep the website running, so the decision was to convert the project to a monorepo.

And for that, we've used the most modern monorepo tool - [turborepo](https://turborepo.com/).

You can see the PR [here](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel/pull/87). It's gigantic, and include 78 files changed. Thanks to the help of Steven I was able to get it out of the door.

### What is Turbo?

[Turbo](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) is an incremental _bundler_ and _build system_ optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.

It consists of 2 parts:

- Turborepo: A CLI tool that runs on your machine, and is responsible for building your project.
- Turbopack: an incremental bundler (the successor to Webpack)

It was built by [Jared Palmer](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer), who is also the creator of [Formik](https://formik.org/).
Monorepo was acquired by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) in 2021.

I've decided to write this guide to help you understand how to convert your project to a monorepo.

### Our Goal

Our goal is to convert a single next.js project to a monorepo with 2 separate apps, and share packages for shared components, logic, and config between them.
The use case we'll mimic is a simple website with 2 sides - A public facing and a dashboard.
They'll both share a common UI library, and a common config.

We will start with a single next.js project, and convert it to a monorepo with separate packages for shared components and logic between 2 apps.
I love using the [next-template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/next-template) by Shadcn for it's simplicity, so we will use it as a starting point.

I recommend you to follow the post along with the [repository](https://github.com/eyalcohen4/step-by-step-guide-to-adding-turborepo-to-existing-project) I've created, where each step is a different branch.

## Preqrequisites

- Git installed locally
- Node.js installed locally
- A basic understanding of Next.js and React

## Step 1: Adding Turborepo

As we start, we have a single next.js project, with a single package.json file.

I've added a sign in button that trigger a simple user authentication modal.

<Image src={`/images/turborepo/singin_button.gif`} width={1800} height={1200} />

We'd want to export the SignIn component to a separate package, so we can use it
in our dashboard app as well.

We'll start by adding turborepo to our project.

```bash
$ pnpm add turbo --global
```

The second step is to create a `turbo.json` file in the repository root folder:

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```

Turborepo will create a .turbo file for us, but we don't want to commit it to git, so we'll add it to our `.gitignore` file:
This line already exist in the template we've used, but if you're starting from scratch, you'll need to add it.

```bash title=".gitignore"
+ .turbo
```

Now we can run `turbo dev` to start our project.

```bash
$ turbo dev
```

If everything was successfull, you should see the following output:

<Image src="/images/turborepo/turbo_dev.png" width={1800} height={1200} />

## Step 2: Convert to a Monorepo

Now that we have turborepo running, we can start converting our project to a monorepo.
Turborepo is built on top of Workspaces, which are package manager feature, like npm, yarn, or pnpm.

> Workspaces are the building blocks of your monorepo.
> Each app and package you add to your monorepo will be inside its own workspace.
> [Turborepo Docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/workspaces)

Workspaces can be defined through `package.json`, and each workspace should have his own package.json as well.

The convention turborepo follow is to create a `packages` folder for shared libraries, and a `apps` folder for apps.
That's customisable, but we'll follow it for this guide.

To convert our single project to a monorepo, we need 3 steps:

1. **Move our single app to the `apps` folder, where our web applications will be**
2. **Define our workspace by creating a `package.json` in the root folder**
3. **Create a packages folder. That's where we'll put our shared components and logic**

### 1. Move our single app to the `apps` folder

Run the following commands in the root folder of our project:

```bash
# create the apps folder
$ mkdir -p ./apps/website

# move the content of our project to the website folder (including hidden files)
# this command may result in an error:.
# mv: rename ./apps to ./apps/website/apps: Invalid argument
# That's fine, you can ignore it.
$ mv ./** ./.** ./apps/website

# Move back the .git folder, .gitignore and .turbo files
$ mv ./apps/website/.git ./apps/website/.gitignore ./apps/website/.turbo ./

# create the dashboard folder
$ mkdir -p ./apps/dashboard

# copy the content of our project to the dashboard folder
$ cp -r ./apps/website ./apps/dashboard
```

The current repo structure should look like this:

```bash
[--] apps
[----] dashboard
[----] website
```

One last step we'd need is to update the names of the packages.

```json title="pacakges/dashboard/package.json"
{
  "name": "dashboard",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true
}
```

```json title="pacakges/website/package.json"
{
  "name": "website",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true
}
```

What we aim for is that when we'll change the SignIn component in one project, it will be reflected in the other project as well.
That's where workspaces & turborepo come in.

### 2. Create a `package.json` in the root folder

```bash
  $ touch package.json
```

Add the following content to it:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "the-best-monorepo",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "packageManager": "pnpm@6.14.1",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo dev"
  }
}
```

```yaml title="pnpm-workspaces.yaml"
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

### 3. Create the packages folder

We'd now want to create the packages folder, where we'll put our shared components and logic.
We can go ahad and create it along with the ui package

```bash
  $ mkdir -p packages/ui
```

Our repo structure should look like this now:

```bash
[--] apps
[----] dashboard
[----] website
[--] packages
[----] ui
```

At the package/ui folder, go ahad and create a `package.json` file inside the package/ui, and add the following content:

```json title="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "@the-best-monorepo/ui",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true
}
```

We've now done creating the monorepo strcuture.

## Step 3 - Create the UI package infrastructure

Let's create our UI package so we can share our SignIn component between our apps.

There are few things we need to do:

- Move the SignIn component to the ui package
- Install dependencies and add build/dev scripts
- Add config files for typescript and tailwind to work

We'll start by copiyng the SignIn component to the ui package, along with the ui folder.

```bash
$ cp apps/website/components/sign-in.tsx apps/website/components/ui ./packages/ui/components
```

### Dependencies & Scripts

Web applications who will use our ui package must have React installed.
We can enforce it via the `peerDependencies` `package.json` property.
We'll also need some other dependencies from our website app, so we'll migrate them to the ui package as well.
Add the following to the ui package.json:

```bash
$ pnpm add @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-slot tailwindcss class-variance-authority clsx lucide-react sharp tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate
$ pnpm add -D tsup typescript postcss prettier eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-tailwind eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks autoprefixer @types/react
```

Great. We now need to edit our `package.json` in 2 ways:

1. Add build & dev scripts
2. Add react as peerDependency

```json title="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup --watch"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.x.x"
  }
}
```

We need React as a peerDependencies, because we don't want to bundle it with our package.
Consuming apps must have it installed, and we'll get a warning if they don't.

### Adding Config Files

We now need to define our build configs in order to bundle our package.
The required tools are: `tsup`, `typesscript`, `tailwind`, and `postcss`.

Copy and paste the following files to the ui package:

```ts title="packages/ui/tsup.config.ts"
import { Options, defineConfig } from "tsup"

export default defineConfig((options: Options) => ({
  entry: ["src/index.ts"],
  banner: {
    js: "'use client'",
  },
  format: ["cjs", "esm"],
  dts: true,
  clean: true,
  external: ["react"],
  injectStyle: true,
  ...options,
}))
```

```json title="packages/ui/tsconfig.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "display": "Default",
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "inlineSources": false,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES6",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noUnusedLocals": false,
    "noUnusedParameters": false,
    "preserveWatchOutput": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

```js title="packages/ui/tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography"), require("tailwindcss-animate")],
}
```

```js title="packages/ui/postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

There's one last thing we need to add for next.js 13, and is that it'll transpile the package for us.

Add the following
Add the following line to `apps/website/next.config.mjs` and `apps/dashboard/next.config.mjs`:

```js
transpilePackages: ["ui"],
```

We're now ready to run the package and see it in action!

## Step 4 - Using the ui package in our website app

Let's build the ui package. Run the following command

```bash title="packages/ui"
$ pnpm run build
```

You should see similar output:

<Image src="/images/turborepo/successfull_run.png" width={1800} height={1200} />

We can now add the ui package to our website and dashboard apps.
In both apps, add the following line to the `package.json` file:

```json title="apps/website/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ui": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

Run `pnpm install` to install on both folders.

We can now replace the import the SignIn component from our ui package, and use it in our website app.
Inside `apps/website/pages/index.tsx` and `apps/dashboard/pages/index.tsx`, replace the import of the SignIn component with the following:

```
import { SignIn } from "ui"
```

Now, Let's change the sign in button color, to make sure it's updates on both apps.

Go to `packages/ui/components/sign-in.tsx`, and change the button variant to `destructive`:

```tsx title="packages/ui/components/sign-in.tsx"
<Button className="w-24" variant="destructive">
  Sign In
</Button>
```

Now, the last step would be to re-build the ui package. You can also re-build it on every change using `pnpm run dev`.

```bash title="packages/ui"
$ pnpm run dev
```

Open 2 other terminals and run:

```bash title="apps/website"
$ pnpm run dev
```

```bash title="apps/dashboard"
$ pnpm run dev
```

We should now see this change reflected in both apps:

<Image src="/images/turborepo/final-step.png" width={1800} height={1200} />

Feel free to change the variant and see the changes on both apps.
