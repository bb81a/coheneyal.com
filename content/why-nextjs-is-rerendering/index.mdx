Today I encountered a weird behavior in one of my Next.js apps, and it was my fault.

I tried navigating to a dynamic route, and the whole app re-rendered, even though it shouldn't. I solved it, and I hope youâ€™ll be able to do so too.

## Why?

Say we a have [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes),
stored under a folder named posts, with the parameter of the id.

The created page URL should be: `posts/[id]`.

```
-- pages
---- posts
------- [id]
```

##### The Folder Structure

In another component, I've tried to do the following:

```jsx
function AnotherPage() {
  return <Link href="/posts/1">Post Number 1</Link>
}
```

Seems pretty straight forward.
But when I clicked the Link tag, the whole page re-rendered.

I looked for a sultion and apperantly, by next.js docs:

> A Link to a dynamic route is a combination of the href and as props.

What I should've done is;

```jsx
function AnotherPage() {
  return (
    <Link href="/posts/[id]" as="/posts/1">
      Post Number 1
    </Link>
  )
}
```

That's it, that's the issue.

By the way, from version 9.5.2 of Next.js - You don't need the `as` property. You can use only the `href`.
Guess what was my version as of writing? 9.5.1 :)
