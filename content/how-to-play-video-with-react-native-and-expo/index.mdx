# Prerequisites

- Run our App: A mobile phone with [Expo](https://expo.io) (SDK for react-native) app installed - Android or [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?ct=www&mt=8) / a Mac, where we can easily use the simulator / [Genymotion emulator](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/)
- Up and running Node and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) / [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) installed on your machine, for managing our packages and generate the app (We’ll use NPM), And a Terminal access.
- Having some basic [React](https://reactjs.org/) knowledge.
- You are passionate about building native apps with Javascript!

# Step 1 — Scaffolding react native app

You can skip this step if you have already used create-react-native-app.

Thanks to the giants at Facebook, the react native community, and Expo team, we can stand on top of them and with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app), skip the configuration phase, and generating all we need to run react-native application, using just one click!

If you didn’t installed create-react-native-app before, run this command on your terminal:

`$ npm install -g create-react-native-app`

Now we can use the tool to create our video app!

`$ create-react-native-app my-video`

after minute or two of progress, a new folder created in our current directory with everything we need. We’ll `cd` i nto the new folder, and start the app using these commands:

```terminal
$ cd my-video
$ npm start
# For Mac users, you can run this instead, and the simulator will open.
$ npm run ios
# For genymotion users (Linux/Windows), you can this:
# npm run android
```

A big QR code is now printed on our terminal, and we can use the Expo app Scan QR Code button to run our app.

If you see a screen with text on your mobile phone, we’re ready to go.

## Step 2 — Rendering the Expo `<Video>` Component

> Expo is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help you build native iOS and Android projects using JavaScript and React.

The Expo SDK, which include components and many more cool stuff, come built-in with create-react-native-app. We are going to use the [Video Component](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/video.html) from it.

Let’s head into our App.js, and import the Video component and the Dimensions object, as in lines 2-3.

Copy & Replace your App class with the following:

Let’s take a quick look at the code. The `App` class is the first component in our app which created by create-react-native-app.

We’ve replaced the default text under the `<View>` tag with the `<Video>` we imported before. Video get many props, but in order to play a video, we only need those 4.

`source` is the important one — if it was `null`, the component wouldn’t display nothing.

You can also play a local file using `require('path/to/file')`, but were using an online .mp4 file. The `uri` property let the component know that we are going to load video from the internet.

`shouldPlay` describing if the media is supposed to play (obviously), and we’re also need the `style` prop to set height & weight, or the video component would play but we couldn’t see nothing. finally, `resizeMode` describing how the video should be scaled for display in the component view bounds.

After all of this, we are now playing a video in react-native!

## Step 3 — Control Bar Strip

Playing video by itself is really cool, but users need to control it, so let’s add A control bar!

We’ll wrap our video component with a view container, and add a black strip for the bar.

At the bottom of App.js, we’re going to add some styles — replace this with your styles variable:

[React native use the Flex box algorithm for layout](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox.html), and by default the [flexDirection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) is set to ‘column’.

If we look at the above code, we’re applying the controlBar object in our styles to a new view, and [“absolute positioning”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) it to the bottom of the container.

We’re also changing the flexDirection to row (for the icons to be side by side), aligning the items to center both vertical and horizontal with `alignItems` and `justifyContent`, and set a black background color with 0.5 opacity.

## Step 4 — Play, Pause And Mute

In order to control the playback status and mute a video, we want to add some [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) to our component. and methods to handle the functionality, by changing the `shouldPlay` and `mute` property.

Now lets add some icons in our strip, and apply the state to our `<Video>` component. we’ll use the expo/vector-icons package, and you should install it by running the following in the Terminal.
`$ npm install --save @expo/vector-icons`

At line 2, we’re import the MaterialIcons package from ‘@expo/vector-icons’.

Later, at the render function, line 14, we set the `shouldPlay` prop of the `<Video>` component to our `shouldPlay` state, and we’re adding an icon to the strip bar, which on press will trigger `handlePlayAndPause`.

The same concept applied to the `isMuted` prop at line 17, and we control him by the press on the icon, which triggering handleVolume (line 24).

Well Done!

## Conclusion

We’ve now played a video in React Native, added a strip bar, and controlled the `shouldPlay` and `isMuted` props!

At step 1, we created a [React Native app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) from scratch, with [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) CLI.

Later, we used the [Expo Video component](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/video.html) to play an online .mp4 video, and in step 3 we added a strip bar to the bottom of the video.

At step 4, we used state, props, and methods to control the Playback status and the volume.
